# DDD Encapsulation Examples (good and bad)

Sample code of encapsulation inside DDD Application Services for my article on Medium [Domain-Driven Design Encapsulation is your BestÂ Friend](https://medium.com/it-dead-inside/domain-driven-design-encapsulation-is-your-best-friend-7192f2fd5369)

## What's in here?
A couple .net core applications

- A simple program.cs with our good and crappy ATM Machine implementations
- A simple asp.net core app with a single API controller calling an application service which in turn calls encapsulated domain logic
